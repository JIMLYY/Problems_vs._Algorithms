# Problems_vs._Algorithms
## Introduction 
This is part of Data Structure and Algorithms Nanodegree at Udacity. In this project, we need to understand and utilize data 
structure such Tree and Trie as well as appropriate algorithms to solve a series of problems. The problems covers sorting and array
manipulation, autocomplete with Tries and so on. We also need to analyze the time and space complexity of our algorithms.
